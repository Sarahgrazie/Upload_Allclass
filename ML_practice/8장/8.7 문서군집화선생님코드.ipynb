      The closest one that gives the most accurate route that I usually take is the Navigon .\\n41                                                                                                                          After 2 weeks, it has yet to make a mistake, and is always completely accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                    It has worked well for local driving giving accurate directions for roads and streets .\\n43

                                                                                 Accuracy is as good as any other unit, they all sometimes tell you you have arrived when you haven't, or continue to tell you to turn when you're already there .\\n45

                                   What the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                    The Garmin is loaded with very accurate maps that generally know the roads in even the remotest areas .\\n50                                                        I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n51                                                                                                                                                       My new Garmin 255w had very Easy Set Up, Accurate Directions to locations, User Friendly Unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .\\n52                                                                                                                                 I had a GPS 10, years ago when I owned a boat that was difficult to use and with very poor accuracy so I had assumed that the road GPS wasn't any better .\\n53

accurate the directions and maps would be .\\n54
